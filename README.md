# Hangman
Example of using redux-saga in a Typescript React project with Cypress automated tests

## Use

To run:
1. Run `yarn start`
2. Open `http://localhost:8080`

## Play:

1. Click start button
2. (Maybe) You may need to click the play area for keyboard events to register
3. Start typing guesses
4. You'll either win by uncovering the whole word or lose by making too many wrong guesses
5. Click start to begin a new game with a new word

## Test

`yarn cypress run` or `yarn cypress open` to run interactively

## Deploy

`yarn deploy`
